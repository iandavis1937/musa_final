## Welcome!

::: {.callout-note}
This website has been developed as a class project for MUSA 5500 at the University of Pennsylvania. 
:::

Past work has shown that poor weather conditions (e.g. rain) can suppress protest activity in the United States, Spain, and Switzerland (Teeselink & Meelios, 2021; Casanueva, 2021; Meier, Schmid, & Stutzer 2019). To explore this relationship, this website offers maps and data visualizations of recent weather conditions and protest activity in Mexico.
